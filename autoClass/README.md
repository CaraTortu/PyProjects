Everyone has dreamt about being counted as present in online meetings without actually being there, right..?

Well fear no more, your dream has come true.

I made this to join my school meetings in quarantine. It automatically joins the meetings and leaves them at specific times, detects what is said and answers to questions detected by the google voice api using prerecorded messages!

Just add the information of the meeting and enjoy your sleep while your bot is answering for you!
